## 🔍 Project Objectives

1. **Prompt Engineering**  
   Create a universal prompt to extract structured content (chapters, topics, sub-topics, exercises, images, activities) from Class 8 NCERT Science books.

2. **Structured Data Output**  
   Use AI APIs to generate structured JSON and Excel outputs from the textbook data.

3. **Knowledge Graph**  
   Generate a text-based knowledge graph showing relationships between chapter elements.

4. **Study Planner Generation**  
   Create a personalized, day-wise study/teaching plan using the extracted content.
